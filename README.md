### 1. Introduction

For Project 1, our journey to become full stack developers began with working as team to design a web application that sets itself apart from other websites. This webpage allows the user to pick their favorite three characters from the MCU and battle against an opposing team of characters.

### 2. Group Project Goals

a. Use two Server Side APIs

b. Implement a four person team on Github with Branching-Workflows

c. Build a web program using agile software development
