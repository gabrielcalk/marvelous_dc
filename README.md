### 1. Introduction

For Project 1, our journey to become full stack developers began with working as team to design a web application that sets itself apart from other websites. This webpage allows the user to pick their favorite three characters from the MCU and battle against an opposing team of characters.

### 2. Group Project Goals

a. Use two Server Side APIs

b. Implement a four person team on Github with Branching-Workflows

c. Build a web program using agile software development

d. Implement Google Branching Workflows

e. Prepare a professional presentation and readme file attached to the presentation.

### 3. Implementation

a. The first APi used is SuperhHeroAPI this API pulls the data called powerscores. This gives a numeric value to assign to each character in order to give a comparision of who won the battle. The results of the comparision show up on the results.html and are committed to local storage. This allows the user to play multiple times and gives them the ability to compare their results with previous scores for the page.

b. the second API used was  super-hero-quotes. This API pulls quotes only from MCU films and is used to generated a different film quote each time the page is refreshed or opened. 

c. In order for the group project to work effectively we implememted Agile Software development. At the beginning of the week we had a meeting where we planned what APIs we wanted to use and how to implement them. Then we designed a mock up of our page including its functionality. Then we developed the page by adding each files framework and tested each change to see what worked what did not. Then each change was evaluated by the programmer to see if it was a viable change or not.

d. In order to implement Agile Software development we took advantage of git branching. Git branching allows each programmer to work in a satellite branch. when the user pushes their work to their side branch. The changes are peer reviewed to make sure that none of the upcoming changes will effect main branch. This also allows for user communication to see the progress of each user. If a change is submitted that will cause a merge conflict github will protect the main repository by making sure some changes are not committed. Github also allows issues to be assigned to other group members and allows others to assign tast so bugs can be worked and task are not being worked on in two different branches this helps to resolve any potential merge conflicts.

### 4. Directions on how to play Marvelous Battles

The game loads to start-game.html and you press the start button. This moves you to the character screen where you choose your team. 15 Characters will be displayed with their images and name in a box with a background they all share. As you mouse over the characters their box has a glowing effect and their box is flipped over to display a text description of the character. You must choose 3 characters and each choice is recorded in a list under the header of the page. Once the 3 characters are selected a hidden button that displays "battle" will appear which when selected takes you to the results page. The computer will have a randomly generated team that the user faces off against. An animation will display, then the results will display to showcase the winning and losing team. The game assigns a predetermined power score through the api which determines the results. The difference in power between the teams is displayed in a box. Images of the teams will be displayed designating the winning and losing team. The results box keeps track of the score between the user and the computer in local storage so multiple plays of the game are recorded. There is a button to reset the score of the game and a play again button that lets you try the game again.

### 5. What We Learned from Adversity

Working together on this group project effective communication is key. We took advantage of the full allottment of resources available to us. This include having a designated slack channel to share ideas and let others know of pull request. Through trial and error we were able to effectively navigate git branching and gel together as a team. This has given us the skills necessary to work on more group projects in the future. We look forward to future projects that may be on the horizon for us. This is a difficult process but our work on any project will never be completed. To quote Walt Disney "Disneyland will never be completed. It will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world.‚Äù This same idea we will take with us with all future projects. In web development features are constantly changing. We need to continue to push forward and to improve build on knowledge we have learned.
